## flask-ecommerce-project
# E-Com

+ #### A simple e commerce project created in ```python``` using the micro web framework ```flask``` and ```SQLAlchemy```.

+ #### This project uses the ```sqlite``` database engine and the ```Flask-SQLAlchemy orm``` to manage database connection and administration.
+ #### I used a monolithic architecture rather than a microservices architecture, since this is just a resume project and will not be put into production for use by the general public.Therefore being easier to maintain.
