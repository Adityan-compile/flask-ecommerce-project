## flask-ecommerce-project
# E-Com

+ #### A simple e commerce project created in ```python``` using the micro web framework ```flask``` and ```SQLAlchemy```.

+ #### This project uses the ```sqlite``` database engine and the ```flask-SQLAlchemy``` ```orm``` to manage database connection and administration.
+ #### I used a ```monolithic``` ```architecture``` rather than a ```microservices``` ```architecture```, since this is just a resume project and will not be put into ```production``` for use by the general public.Therefore being easier to maintain.
